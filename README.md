# Smash Stats

Created with [electron-forge](https://www.electronforge.io/).

This was my first major project using HTML, CSS, and JS to create a desktop app with electron, so some of the styling is wonky in places. Apologies!

## Features

- track improvement at the game over time in a qualitative, objective way via the custom score system
- take into account all the factors -- CPU or human opponent, CPU level, character archetypes -- to see what areas of your game need improvement
- view in-depth visualizations of proficiency with each character on the roster, as well as see their speed, weight, archetype, and moves within the app
- an intutive interface which makes it easy to record each and every match played

## Running

Running should be as easy as getting the code and then `npm i` and `npm start`.
